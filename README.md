- 👋 Hi, I’m @glenn-engstrand
- 👀 I’m interested in [Software Architecture Focused on Open Source Technology](https://glennengstrand.info/blog/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about [github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), [platform ecosystems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/platform-ecosystems/9780124080669/), and the history of [microfrontend development](https://www.manning.com/books/micro-frontends-in-action).
- 💞️ I enjoyed [presenting at QCon on how we manage tech debt](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/microservices-tech-debt/) and participating in a follow up [podcast about tech debt](https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/managing-tech-debt/).
